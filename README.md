The URL Shortener Service converts long and complex URLs into short, easy-to-share links. When a user accesses the shortened URL, the service redirects them to the original long URL. This system is commonly used to improve link readability, simplify sharing on social media, and track link usage such as number of clicks. It provides a fast, efficient, and user-friendly way to manage and share web links.
